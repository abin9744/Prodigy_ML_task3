# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It uses the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction technique and the scikit-learn library for SVM implementation.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is the Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle. It contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy
scikit-learn
opencv-python
scikit-image
